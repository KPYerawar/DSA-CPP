Data types specify the type of data that a variable can store. Whenever a variable is defined in C++, the compiler allocates some memory for that variable based on the data type with which it is declared as every data type requires a different amount of memory.

C++ supports a wide variety of data types, and the programmer can select the data type appropriate to the needs of the application.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Character Data Type (char)
The character data type is used to store a single character. The keyword used to define a character is char. Its size is 1 byte, and it stores characters enclosed in single quotes (' '). It can generally store upto 256 characters according to their ASCII codes.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Integer Data Type (int)
Integer data type denotes that the given variable can store the integer numbers. The keyword used to define integers is int. Its size is 4-bytes (for 64-bit) systems and can store numbers for binary, octal, decimal and hexadecimal base systems in the range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Boolean Data Type (bool)
The boolean data type is used to store logical values: true(1) or false(0). The keyword used to define a boolean variable is bool. Its size is 1 byte.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Floating Point Data Type (float)
Floating-point data type is used to store numbers with decimal points. The keyword used to define floating-point numbers is float. Its size is 4 bytes (on 64-bit systems) and can store values in the range from 1.2e-38 to 3.4e+38.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. Double Data Type (double)
The double data type is used to store decimal numbers with higher precision. The keyword used to define double-precision floating-point numbers is double. Its size is 8 bytes (on 64-bit systems) and can store the values in the range from 1.7e-308 to 1.7e+308
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
6. Void Data Type (void)
The void data type represents the absence of value. We cannot create a variable of void type. It is used for pointer and functions that do not return any value using the keyword void.

Type Safety in C++
C++ is a strongly typed language. It means that all variables' data type should be specified at the declaration, and it does not change throughout the program. Moreover, we can only assign the values that are of the same type as that of the variable.
